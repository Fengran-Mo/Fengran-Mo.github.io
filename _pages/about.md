I am now on the job market and looking for any academic positions in North America and Europe. I am sincerely appreciate any help, guidance, and information!

I am a final-year Ph.D. student at the RALI Lab of Universit√© de Montr√©al. I am fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Jian-Yun Nie](http://rali.iro.umontreal.ca/nie-site/jian-yun-nie-en/). I obtained my Master degree in Computer Science from Universit√© de Montr√©al, Canada (08.2022) and Bachelor degree from Dalian University of Technology, China (07.2020). 

I have broad interests in Conversational and Interactive AI, Information Retrieval (IR), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Large Language Models (LLMs), Multilingualism, User Modeling, and AI for domain applications and social goods. My research focuses on (1) how to integrate retriever and generative models to improve the effectiveness, efficiency, robustness, and trustworthiness of the conversational AI systems; (2) how to improve user-centric experience and facilitate human-machine interaction via personalization, behavior modeling, proactive learning, multiple agent-human collaboration, and adapt to multilingual, multi-modality, domain-specific, and privacy-preserving scenarios.
My future research vision is to build up interactive AI systems and benefit various background users with effective and efficient interaction between humans and AI assistants to achieve their diverse goals.

I have ever received Best Paper Award Nominations in WWW 2023 and Best Resource Paper Award in EMNLP 2024, and was awarded the Canada Mitacs Globalink Research Scholarship (2020), Montreal AI Scholarship (2021), and Bourses d'excellence Merit Student (2021-2025). I have been the Area Chair for the ACL series conference (ACL, EMNLP, NAACL, EACL) since 2024 and regularly served as a PC member/reviewer in top-tier conferences and prestigious journals, including SIGIR, SIGKDD, WSDM, CIKM, WWW, IJCAI, ICLR, TOIS, TIST, IPM, CRUS, etc.

My curriculum vitae is available [here](../files/CV.pdf).
